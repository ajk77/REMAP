Improved documentation at the top of most files. 
Fixed bug where v2RRT tables weren't showing RRT from the IO source tables.

Improved Readme. 

v3CalculatedStateHypoxiaAtEnroll will take PaO2 values (and corresponding FiO2/PEEP) from any time pre-enrollment (rather than within 24 hours before). 

optiflo added to HFNC device list. 

Okay, so relaxed HFNC is no more. Instead,  "O2 support" will be:
sub_standard_meaning = 'Oxygen therapy delivery device' 
result_str in ('HFNC device' , 'NC', 'Mask', 'Nonrebreather', 'Prebreather') 
result_str for 'HFNC device' =  ['%high flow nasal cannula%'. '%hfnc%', '%airvo%', '%optiflo%']
 result_str  for 'NC', 'Mask', 'Nonrebreather',  and 'Prebreather' = SELECT source_text FROM COVID_SUPPLEMENT.TEXT_STANDARDIZATION WHERE source_table = 'CE_PHYSIO' AND sub_standard_meaning IN ('NC', 'Mask', 'Nonrebreather', 'Prebreather')
any documented O2 flow rate within +-12 hours of the device

With the new v3SupplementalOxygenInstance query, I filter out rows associated with events that qualified as organ support HFNC. So yes, this table (and newly created COVID_PHI.v2SupplementalOxygenInstanceM/S)  correctly identify data corresponding to 'Hospitalised, low‚Äêflow oxygen by mask or nasal prongs'. 

COVID_PHI.v2RelaxedHFNCInstanceM/S is now depreciated and deleted. I updated the Daily CRF views to set 'HFNC' = '<DEPRECIATED>'. 'OS_HFNC' still performs the same as before. 

I also removed RRT from v3OrganSupportInstance and created a standalone v3RRTInstance table. Edvin, querying RRT from the v2 tables is unchanged.
